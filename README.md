This is your entry point into `ogs` development.

Here you can see directories that represent evolutionary stages of `ogs`

* [01.EmptyScreen][01.EmptyScreen]
    * This is the base of `ogs` to let it run on supported platforms and display an empty screen, nothing more.

[01.EmptyScreen]: 01.EmptyScreen
